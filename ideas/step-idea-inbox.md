# Step Idea Inbox

Persistent capture area for loose thoughts and step ideas that aren't tied to an objective yet.

## Concept

- Quick capture without commitment
- Ideas can be promoted to steps on an objective later
- Or stay as reference material
- AI sees these for context when generating suggestions

## UI

```
┌─ Inbox ──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  + Add idea...                                       │
│                                                      │
│  • "Maybe try SQLite instead of JSON"                │
│  • "Ask Jake about deployment"                       │
│  • "Research calendar UI libraries"                  │
│  • "That auth pattern from the blog post"            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Behavior

- Always accessible
- Loose, unstructured
- Can attach to objective later or leave floating
- Influences next step suggestions
